# SpaceInvaders
 
### Space Invaders is a galaga inspired star wars themed game.

You play as an Empire pilot, piloting the iconic Tie Fighter. Your goal is to stop the rebels, and end the rebellion.

This game is built using the programming language **Processing**, a graphical library which uses the **Java** programming language.
The physical controls were built using an arduino board, tilt sensors, and a button.
To emulate piloting the Tie Fighter, the tilt sensors are checking in which direction you are going. You press the button to shoot your missiles.

To play you would need to:

- Download Processing. [download here](https://processing.org/download)

  - arduino board
  - tilt sensors
  - button

  - resistors
 - You can then download this repo, and play away.
